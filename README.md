# Health-Nutrition-Physical-Activity-Data-Visualization-using-Tableau
Project Topic: Health, Nutrition & Physical Activity dataset visualization using tableau
      
Introduction:
The food we eat gives our bodies the "information" and materials they need to function properly. If we don't get the right information, our metabolic processes suffer and our health declines. What we eat is central to our health. Considering Webster's definition of medicine: "The science and art dealing with the maintenance of health and the prevention, alleviation, or cure of disease." 
Since different food contain different levels of nutrition, our body will be affected by the food we eat every day. Food can contribute to our skin, eyes, brain, digestion, anti-aging, strong muscles, immune system, heart, and lower cholesterol.

As obesity in America continues to skyrocket, we suffer from many cascading effects of the disease. Obesity largely contributes to diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other disorders. Apart from obesity, many other health problems that can arise later in life may be prevented by an improved diet. Better food choices, especially early in life, can help reverse some of these growing trends. In this project, we try to influence diet decisions by providing good visualizations of food data.

Research Questions:
1.	Why has obesity been getting worse over time in the United States of America?
2.	Obesity leads to chronic deceases, treatment costs high in the USA, does Income and wealth affect people take health insurance?

Data Sources: 

1.	I got the CDC Nutrition, Physical Activity, & Obesity data from Kaggle.com 
2.	I got the economic data for 2016 to 2020 from census.org
3.	I needed Inflation data for my research which I got from world bank website.
4.	National obesity data from CDC website.


Analysis: 

No reported leisure physical activity seems to be strongly correlated with obesity rates across different state. Many other factors correlate to obesity, but I was trying to hypothesize what would be the strongest. This data set is covering averages from adults across a whole state, The accrued data should be enough to ensure good correlation.
Unhealthy eating habits and less physical activity along with other parameters like, age, gender, geography, income, race, education are the factors responsible for obesity in the United States of America. 
Higher obesity leads to formulation of diseases and mental as well as physical health problems which has high cost of healthcare expenditure, the number of people below poverty line is somewhat matches the number of people uninsured for health insurance. 
Income, wealth, and education along with many other factors are affecting the population staying without medical expenditure coverage. I feel the medical benefits like universal health coverage to the population below poverty line may help them deal with medical health expenditure.
